## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
- [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked.
- [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked.
- [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
- [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.
- [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
- [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
- [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
- [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
- [x] Playback speeds up on each turn
- [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
- [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
- [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
- [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
- [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
   I used prior knowledge from a freeCodeCamp course on CSS/HTML, then I also looked at w3schools.com, javatpoint.com, 
   and developer.mozilla.org for CSS & javascript info.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   The approach to constructing the program was a little weird for me, because we declared many variables, gave structure to the program,
   and defined most of the game logic without actually defining the guessing system, so I was slightly confused on what progress and
   guessCounter were for. After working on the guess logic for a bit everything made sense, and in the future I just need to continue
   with the workshop instead of scaring myself off just because CSS/HTML is very different or because the approach to constructing a
   website is strange to me.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   I'm interested in how/if web development languages like JS can be used in backend operations, or as a backend interface.
   I'm also curious on the CSS aspect of web development, because I feel as if it requires some graphic design knowledge
   and a different type of creativity than traditional code, but I'm not a graphic designer nor am I very artistic. In a
   professional setting, would a web developer or UI developer be assisted by a graphic design artist, or are you expected
   to pick up some artistic creativity along the way?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   I would've liked to implement a start menu with two modes as options: the traditional mode specified in the prework,
   and an endless mode which would simply continue looping until the user runs out of mistakes/lives, but there would be an accompanying leaderboard for the endless mode.
   There's other features I'd like to add from the optional features list and my own thoughts, but for a few hour time-frame I would probably stick to the above.
